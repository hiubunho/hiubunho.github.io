<h2 id="needfinding"><strong>NEEDFINDING</strong></h2>
<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw overcrowded emergency rooms, shortages of doctors and nurses and disruptions to routine care.</p>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/situation.png" alt="situation"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>From the picture, we can see that there are too many people waiting in the hospital, and people infected with COVID-19 cannot receive timely treatment. In addition, there is a shortage of medication resources, and people find it difficult to purchase the medicine they need. Many people have sequelae after recovering from COVID-19 but do not know how to deal with them.</p>
<p>Overall, we have the following two findings:
(1)People urgently need a telemedicine platform that can help people seek medical help online, such as doctor diagnosis and AI Q&amp;A.
(2)People need an online social platform to communicate symptoms and precautions after rehabilitation, as well as to exchange medical items.</p>
<h2 id="brainstorming">BRAINSTORMING</h2>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/brainstorming.png" alt="brainstorming"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>After some discussion, each member of our group exchanged their ideas and agreed that we could establish a a telemedicine platform to provide patients with a more convenient option. For the patient discussion forum, patients can share their experiences of fighting against diseases on it. However, we need to protect the privacy of patients, so patients can choose to post their comments anonymously or with their real names. For AI-assisted diagnosis, we consider using intelligent chat tools such as chatGPT to provide patients with lifestyle and dietary advice. ChatGPT can also be used for preliminary diagnosis of patients to speed up the diagnosis process of authoritative doctors. In order to reduce the misdiagnosis rate, we still need authoritative doctors to provide professional patient diagnosis reports and treatment plans in the end.</p>

<h2 id="speed-dating-and-user-feedback">SPEED DATING AND USER FEEDBACK</h2>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/speed_dating.png" alt="speed_dating"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>We took speed dating with some interviewees. And we received their comments and suggestions for the telemedicine platform. They are shown as follows:</p>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/comments.png" alt="comments"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>Combining the suggestions of the interviewees, we should add drug purchase and drug delivery services to the telemedicine platform. In addition, we should connect patients&rsquo; medical insurance systems on the telemedicine platform and allow patients to apply for medical expense reimbursement.</p>
<h2 id="our-final-idea">OUR FINAL IDEA</h2>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/final_idea.png" alt="final_idea"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>We can create a telemedicine platform that mainly consists of three parts: AI-Assisted Diagnosis, Online Medical Diagnosis by Doctors, and Patient Discussion Forum. In addition, we add drug purchase and drug delivery services to the telemedicine platform.</p>
<h2 id="video-prototype">VIDEO PROTOTYPE</h2>
<video width="800" height="400" class="video-shortcode" preload="auto" controls>
    <source src="/video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    There should have been a video here but your browser does not seem
    to support it.
</video>


<p>You can check out the prototype video to see how the telemedicine platform works.</p>
<h2 id="key-features"><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></h2>
<p>The following are the interface designs of the mobile application of the telemedicine platform.</p>
<p>  <p class="md-image">

</p>
<p>The main functions of the telemedicine platform that we designed.</p>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/feature2.png" alt="feature2"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>We can make online enquiries and appointments on the telemedicine platform.</p>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/feature3.png" alt="feature3"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/feature4.png" alt="feature4"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>When making an online appointment on the telemedicine platform, we can choose different specialties and experts.</p>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/feature5.png" alt="feature5"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>You can describe your symptoms by voice input or text input in the text box. In addition, you can upload personal physical examination reports to assist doctors in diagnosis.</p>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/feature6.png" alt="feature6"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>HealthGPT plays the role of an advisor and can provide us with lifestyle and dietary advice, as well as assist authoritative doctors in diagnosing diseases.</p>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/feature7.png" alt="feature7"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>  <p class="md-image">
  <img src="/img/feature9.png" alt="feature9"  />
  </p>
</p>
<p>In the patient discussion forum, users can share their experiences of fighting diseases and healthy eating suggestions, like or comment on other people’s posts, follow other users and chat with other users.</p>
<h2 id="what-have-i-done">WHAT HAVE I DONE</h2>
<p>We have held several group meetings to discuss the topic selection and design of the project. After analyzing the current situation in the post-pandemic era, we decided to establish a telemedicine platform. I was responsible for recording the group meetings and drawing brainstorming maps about the project. In addition, I put forward my own ideas on the design of the storyboard and participated in discussions on how to conduct user testing. In order to improve the project, I sorted out, analyzed and summarized the suggestions and comments from users’ feedback, identified problems that exist in the telemedicine platform and functions that need to be added or modified, and put forward some suggestions for the design of the interface and prototype video.</p>
<h2 id="reflection">REFLECTION</h2>
<p>Telemedicine platforms have become increasingly popular during the pandemic and are expected to continue to grow in the post-pandemic era.The Covid-19 pandemic has changed healthcare. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw overcrowded emergency rooms, shortages of doctors and nurses and disruptions to routine care. Telemedicine platforms have become a more convenient option, helping to protect doctors and reduce the risk of infection, and allowing economically underdeveloped communities and rural areas to obtain the healthcare they need.</p>
<p>The project we designed is very challenging and meaningful. Telemedicine platforms have many advantages, such as convenience, cost savings, reduced risk of infection, and providing medical services for people in remote areas or with mobility limitations. At the same time, it also has some problems, such as patient privacy issues, potential risks of misdiagnosis by HealthGPT, and inability to perform physical examinations and tests remotely. In the future, we need to further improve this project. At the same time, I also believe that more excellent telemedicine platforms will emerge in the future to provide medical services for more patients in need.</p>
<p>Thanks to this course and Professor Ma for letting me know a lot about human-computer interaction. Thanks to all my group members for giving me the opportunity to participate in this very meaningful project. Thank you again.</p>
